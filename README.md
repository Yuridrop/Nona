# What is Nona?

Nona is a Discord nuke bot optimised down to the milisecond using technologies like Redis++ with the body being written in C++ for a faster operation speed than that of Python or Javascript like previous revisions of the bot have been written in.

# What is the purpose of Nona?

The purpose of Nona is simple. Nona was created to be the most efficient and fastest nuke bot in the entire history of Discord and hopefully for the foreseeable future. It integrates more commands than typical Discord bots including (somewhat) minimal auto-doxing of select members, self-botting, malware spreading, token and password bruteforcing and more.
